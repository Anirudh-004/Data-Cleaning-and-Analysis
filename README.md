## Building a Movie Recommendation System using Python and its libraries.

## Setup:

* Install Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

* Install Python Flask: https://pypi.org/project/Flask/

## Explanation: 

* Building a movie recommendation system using various technologies such as machine learning, data mining, data analysis, web scraping. 

* To make the data pre-processing easier and efficient we have used python.

* We have implemented this movie recommendation system using python flask and scikit learn machine learning algorithm. It uses cosine similarity in-order to recommend the movies that has been sourced.

* The user interface was implemented using HTML, CSS, AJAX and Javascript.
